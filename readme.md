# CTEC3905 Assignment

I chose to design a website for Web Development agency with 5 pages called WebInventive. The inspiration is from my business which is a professional media agency the purpose was to recreate the already existing website https://webinventive.co.uk/ using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This experience adds valuable skills required for web development and helps boost confidence for taking up projects for my business.
